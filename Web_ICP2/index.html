        <h1>Worship Music</h1>
        <h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
        <p>For about the past 4 or 5 years, I have played worship music at my <a href="https://www.lifegatekc.org" target="_blank">
            church</a> every Sunday.        <!-- uses inline a to link to my church's site-->
        <br>I am one of our two drummers. I am also learning piano on my own with the hopes to someday play this
        instrument at my church as well.</p>
        <h2>Worship Artists</h2>
        <p><span class="class1">Below are some of my <em>favorite</em> worship artists:</span></p>

        <h2>Steps to Playing Music</h2>
        <p>To become a worship musician, there a few things to keep in mind:</p>
        <ol>                               <!-- uses inline bold for each list title -->
            <li><strong>Practice</strong> - Just because you are playing for a community does not mean you
            don't put in the work. You should play your best, and that means you should practice.</li>
            <li><strong>It's Not About You</strong> - When playing for ministry, don't try to solo or draw attention
            to yourself. You are there to help people worship God, so don't distract them.</li>
            <li><strong>Actually Worship</strong> - God has given you a gift and you have the opportunity to use your
                talents for Him. Don't be so focused on being perfect that you forget why you are playing.</li>
        </ol>
